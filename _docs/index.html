<div class="introduction">
  <h1>Hi.</h1>

  <p>Green Pipes is a composable middleware framework which extends the Task Parallel Library (TPL) designed around the widely understood concept of pipes and filters. By leveraging _Tasks_, filters can execute quickly while also remaining asynchronous friendly.</p>

  <p>You would use Green Pipes if you want to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Build a reactive, event-driven application</li>
    <li>Enable developers to add behavior to applications</li>
  </ul>
